                <p> <strong>Java</strong> is a high-level computer programming language (not to be confused with JavaScript). </p>
                <p> <strong>Java</strong> is known to be a high-level programming language because of how easy humans can read and understand the code. </p>
                <p> It was developed by James Gosling and his team in the early 1990s as an improvement of C++. </p>
                <p> <strong>Java</strong> was designed to be easy to use, reliable, secure, and available to be used on any platform. </p>
                <p> First built for use on cell phones, <strong>Java</strong> has moved its focus onto the internet. </p>
                <p> An example of <strong>Java</strong> being used is to create animated and interactive webpages. </p>
